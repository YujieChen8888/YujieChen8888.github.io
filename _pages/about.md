# 🔬 Research Projects

## 1. Enhancing Photovoltaic Power Forecasting Accuracy through Nonlinear Weather Correction Based on Multi-Task Learning

- **Challenge:** PV forecasting is highly sensitive to weather variables, and simple features fail to capture the complex nonlinear relationship between PV power and weather.
- **Highlight:** 
  - Proposed a multi-angle framework using weather variables to improve PV forecasting accuracy.
  - Introduced a customized multi-task learning model to capture complex weather-PV interactions.
  - Developed an MLP-based weather correction model to refine PV predictions with nonlinear interactions.
  - Validated the model using real-world PV data from Australia, showing improved accuracy.
- **Published** as corresponding author and co-first author in **Applied Energy**.

## 2. A Crude Oil Price Forecasting Framework Based on Constraint Guarantee and Pareto Front Shrinking Strategy

- **Challenge:** Multi-objective optimization methods have shown success in ensemble learning for crude oil price forecasting, but selecting solutions from the Pareto front to improve prediction accuracy remains a challenge.
- **Highlight:** 
  - Proposed a multi-strategy ensemble learning framework to enhance crude oil price forecasting accuracy.
  - Introduced the Constraint Guarantee Strategy for selecting solutions from the Pareto front suitable for engineering applications.
  - Developed a customized Pareto Front Shrinking Strategy for objectively selecting a unique solution on the Pareto front.
- **Published** as first author in **Applied Soft Computing**.

## 3. A Novel Ensemble Learning Framework Based on News Sentiment Enhancement and Multi-objective Optimizer for Carbon Price Forecasting

- **Challenge:** Carbon price forecasting is influenced by news sentiment, and how to quantify sentiment and improve model robustness and accuracy using ensemble learning remains a challenge.
- **Highlight:** 
  - Proposed a hybrid forecasting framework combining news sentiment enhancement with multi-objective optimization to improve carbon price forecasting accuracy.
  - Integrated NLP techniques to extract news sentiment features and incorporate them into time series prediction models.
  - Developed a Pareto front selection mechanism with knee point strategies to enhance model robustness.
- **Published** as first author in **Computational Economics**.

## 4. Traffic Speed Prediction with Time-Varying Spatial Indistinguishability using a Mixture of Experts Model

- **Challenge:** Traditional spatio-temporal forecasting models face challenges when spatial indistinguishability varies over time, complicating the prediction of traffic speed and flow.
- **Highlight:** 
  - Introduced a Mixture of Experts (MoE) model, TTVSI, to dynamically capture time-varying spatial indistinguishability for more accurate traffic speed prediction.
  - Developed a time-varying metric to assess spatial indistinguishability, enabling the model to adaptively switch between sequence-centric and variable-centric approaches.
  - Achieved significant performance improvements, with a 4.37% to 11.53% enhancement in forecasting accuracy across multiple datasets, surpassing state-of-the-art models.
- **Under Review** in **Information Fusion**.
